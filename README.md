# Flight_fare_prediction
#### In this project I will be predicting the Fare of a flight a person has to give on inputting the data using the normal Machine Learning techniques then I will see how I can do the same thing with the help of using Auto SK Learn which is a Auto ML Library.
We have often heared travellers saying Flight TIckets are often very unpredictable and are very hard to guess. If one might see a price today and checks the same flight price tommorow it's a whole different story by then.
Let us create a Machine Learning Model which will help us in predicting the prices of a flight on inputting some of the attributes. Here we will be provided with prices of flight tickets for various airlines between the months of March and June of 2019 and between various cities.
